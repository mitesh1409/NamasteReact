hello-react
    |- index.html

HTML only version, check index-1.html.

## #2 React - library or framework?

## #3 Extensions recommended in VS Code

- Bracket Pair Colorization Toggler
- Better Comments
- ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets
- ESLint
- GitLens - Git supercharged
- Prettier - Code formatter
- Prettier ESLint
- Prettify JSON

## #4 Inject/integrate React into the app

Using CDN we can easily inject/integrate React into our application.
[React CDN](https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html)

There are two libraries
- React
- ReactDOM

## #5 Smallest React program/app

We start with bare minimum HTML document and
then once we integrate React into our application (via CDN),
this is the smallest React app.

Once React is injected/integrated into our app we have
"React" & "ReactDOM" available for use.
We can check this in the browser console.

## #6 React element

React element is an object.

## #7 Binding React

We can bind React to one or more parts of the application,
and execute it only for those elements.

## #8 React overrides existing content

When we create root element and render something inside it,
the existing content gets overriden.

## #9 JSX Vs. React.createElement


# Homework/Assignment

1. What is Emmet?
2. What is CDN?
3. What is crossorigin?
```
    <script
        crossorigin
        src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"
    ></script>
```
4. async Vs. defer
5. React Vs. ReactDOM
