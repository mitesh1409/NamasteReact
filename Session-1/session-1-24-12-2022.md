## #1 Hello World App in React

hello-react
    |- index.html

HTML only version, check index-1.html.
JavaScript only version, check index-2.html.
React only version, check index-3.html & check index-4.html.


## #2 React - Library or Framework? What is React?

React is "a JavaScript library for building user interfaces",
as mentioned on the official website [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/).

- React is a JavaScript library - one of the most popular ones
- React is not a framework (unlike Angular, which is more opinionated).
- React is an open-source project created by Facebook.
- React is used to build user interfaces (UI) on the front end.
- React is the view layer of an MVC application (Model View Controller)

There are two parts of the React library:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html) - the React top level API
- [ReactDOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html) - adds DOM-specific methods

"React" & "ReactDOM" objects are available once React library is injected into our app.


## #3 Extensions Recommended in VS Code

- Bracket Pair Colorization Toggler
- Better Comments
- ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets
- ESLint
- GitLens - Git supercharged
- Prettier - Code formatter
- Prettier ESLint
- Prettify JSON
- vscode-icons
- Emmet


## #4 Inject/integrate React into the app

Using CDN we can easily inject/integrate React into our application.
[React CDN](https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html)


## #5 Smallest React App

We start with bare minimum HTML document and
then once we integrate React into our application (via CDN),
this is the smallest React app.

Once React is injected/integrated into our app we have
"React" & "ReactDOM" available for use.
We can check this in the browser console.


## #6 React Element

The React element is an object.


## #7 Binding React

We can bind React to one or more parts of the application,
and execute it only for those elements.

Check index-4.html, see how React is bound to multiple elements of the page.


## #8 React Overrides Existing Content

When we create root element and render something inside it,
the existing content gets overriden.

Check index-4.html.


## #9 JSX Vs. React.createElement

JSX allows us to write markup very easily, its more like writing HTML.
JSX produces React “elements”.
JSX is compiled to JavaScript code.

[JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

It becomes very hard to write markup using plain JavaScript or say using
`React.createElement`.
The code quickly becomes clumsy, complex and non-maintainable when we write
markup this way.
JSX makes it more easier, since it resembles with HTML.
Markup written in JSX is easier to read and maintain.
