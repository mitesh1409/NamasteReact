# Igniting our App | Session Highlights

## #1 Building your own Create React App

## #2 Bundlers

We need to use "Bundlers" to make a production build of our app.
In the production build
- the html/css/js is minified
- assets like images are optimized
etc.

For example
- [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [parcel](https://parceljs.org/)

## #3 Using Parcel

Parcel is a zero configuration build tool for the web.
Its available as an npm package.

[parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
[parcel package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parcel)

What parcel is doing
- HMR - Hot Module Replacement
- File watcher, keeps track of each and every file changes
- Bundling assets for the dev/production build
- Minification
- Image optimization
- Super fast build algorithm
- Caching while development
- Compression
- Compatible with older versions of browser, adds polyfills
- Allows to enable HTTPS protocol on development environment
- It manages port number, if already used then uses different one
- Consistent Hashing Algorithm
- Zero Configuration
- Tree Shaking (removing unwanted code)

Refer
[Polyfill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill)

Put .parcel-cache folder into .gitignore file.

## #4 npm

npm is a "JavaScript package manager".

Using npm we can
- install
- uninstall
- upgrade/downgrade
the dependencies/packages of our JavaScript application.

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

Importance of package.json & package-lock.json files
[configuring-npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm)
[package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json)
[package-lock.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-lock-json)

`npm install -D <package-name>`
`npm install --save-dev <package-name>`
Package will appear in your "devDependencies".

`npm install -P <package-name>`
`npm install --save-prod <package-name>`
Package will appear in your "dependencies".

## #5 Transitive Dependencies

An app can have one or more dependencies,
and those dependencies in turn can have their own dependencies,
and so on. It forms a dependency tree.
This is known as Transitive Dependencies.

## #6 browserslist

Explore "browserslist" in the package.json file.

A page to display compatible browsers from [browserslist string](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist).
